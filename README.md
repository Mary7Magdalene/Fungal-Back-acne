# Fungal-Back-acne
Fungal back acne, also known as pityrosporum folliculitis, is a skin condition caused by an overgrowth of yeast (Malassezia) on the skin. It often appears as small, itchy, red or pus-filled bumps on the back, shoulders, and chest, resembling regular acne but differing in its underlying cause. Factors such as excessive sweating, humid climates, tight clothing, poor hygiene, weakened immunity, and excessive use of oily skincare products can contribute to its occurrence. Unlike bacterial acne, fungal acne requires antifungal treatments rather than traditional acne medications. Early diagnosis and proper management, including maintaining skin hygiene, wearing breathable clothing, and using antifungal treatments, can help prevent and treat the condition effectively.

Fungal Back Acne Prediction using Machine Learning This project aims to predict the occurrence of fungal back acne based on various environmental and personal conditions. Using machine learning techniques, the model analyzes factors such as lifestyle, skin type, hygiene habits, and climate to determine the likelihood of developing the infection.

Dataset The dataset consists of records with multiple features related to an individual's health, skin condition, and environmental factors. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of fungal back acne.
The several factors and conditions  used as the feature names include:
Age, Gender, Skin Type,Climate, Exercise Frequency,Sweating Level, Use of Tight Clothing, Skin Care Routine,Hygiene, Diet, Recent Medications,History of fungal infections and Stress Level.
